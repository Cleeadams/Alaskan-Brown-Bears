<h1>Brief description of the project</h1>
<p>In this thesis, we explored the effects of climate change on two species: Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus) and Alaskan brown bears (Ursus arctos). The study compares two models that predict the long-term outcomes of these species under different temperature scenarios. The first model assumes a constant temperature, while the second takes into account temperature changes over time.

The research finds that the effects of global warming may have serious consequences for both species. Pacific salmon may either die off or migrate to areas that are more suitable for their environmental needs. This could result in a decrease in the population of brown bears as they would lose a significant food source.

The conclusion of this thesis highlights the importance of understanding the impacts of climate change and the role it plays in the survival of species. The results suggest that it is essential to take measures to minimize the impacts of global warming to protect the biodiversity of our planet.</p>

<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>Climate change has been a popular topic since James Hansen gave his testimony to 
Congress in 1988, expressing the disasters that would come from global warming.
Many researchers are studying climate change in hopes of predicting its effects. If we
can anticipate the outcomes of climate change, we can take measures to minimize
or eliminate the catastrophes that will follow. In this thesis, we compare two
models that determine the long-term outcome of two interactive species, pacific
salmon Oncorhynchus and Alaskan brown bears Ursus arctos. The first model
predicts the outcome of the species when temperature is constant, and the other
when temperature is a function of time. We conclude that the effects of global
warming could cause the pacific salmon to either die off or migrate to an area
that is more suitable for their environmental needs, resulting in the brown bear
population decreasing in size to accommodate for the elimination of a food source.</p>
